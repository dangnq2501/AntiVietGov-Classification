## Overview
The rebellious post classifier is built using deep learning techniques, specifically recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures such as GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). It takes as input text content, and predicts the rebellious level of the post. The classifier can identify whether posts are rebellious or not.

This repository contains code for a rebellious post classifier, a machine learning model designed to classify posts into different categories based on their toxicity levels. The classifier can be used to automatically detect and filter out rebellious posts, helping to create safer online communities.

## Dependencies
The rebellious post classifier requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Torch
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Streamlit

## Key Features
* Custom layout
  - With this feature, users cantailor their dashboard experience according to their unique preferences and priorities.
* Data Statistics
  - When users record their upcoming tasks, the virtual assistant will automatically distribute the user's tasks into sections according to the P.A.R.A structure.
* Demo of the best GRU Model with an Input
  - By using users' personal data, the assistant can provide useful recommendations for users.
  - Exercises recommendations: Providing user with manys work out that can be filtered to fit with user
  - Diet recommendation: Check health of user according meal, workout frequency and give strategy and healthy recipes for user  
* 3D Visualization with T-SNE and PCA 
  - The created feature acts as an effective assistant for users with the ability to give accurate answers and perform assigned tasks.
