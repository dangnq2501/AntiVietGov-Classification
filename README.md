  Anti-Vietnamese Government post Classification
</h1>

This repository contains code for a rebellious post classifier, a machine learning model designed to classify posts into different categories based on their toxicity levels. The classifier can be used to automatically detect and filter out rebellious posts, helping to create safer online communities.

## Overview
The rebellious post classifier is built using deep learning techniques, specifically recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures such as GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). It takes as input text content, and predicts the rebellious level of the post. The classifier can identify whether posts are rebellious or not.

## Dependencies
The rebellious post classifier requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Torch
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Streamlit

## Key Features
* Auto Functions
  - With this feature, users can assign simple tasks to virtual assistants. Then, the virtual assistant will automatically handle those tasks for the user before the specified deadline
* Organize tasks accroding to P.A.R.A structure
  - When users record their upcoming tasks, the virtual assistant will automatically distribute the user's tasks into sections according to the P.A.R.A structure.
* Recommendations:
  - By using users' personal data, the assistant can provide useful recommendations for users.
  - Exercises recommendations: Providing user with manys work out that can be filtered to fit with user
  - Diet recommendation: Check health of user according meal, workout frequency and give strategy and healthy recipes for user  
* Virtual assistant: 
  - The created feature acts as an effective assistant for users with the ability to give accurate answers and perform assigned tasks.
* Cross platform supported!
* Ability to collect data and summarize a document according to the topic user require
* Context search on video and summarize üòé
